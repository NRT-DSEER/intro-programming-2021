# Introduction to Scientific Computing 2021 Bootcamp Materials
This repo houses data and notebooks for the 2021 DSEER "Introduction to Scientific Computing" bootcamp.

## Instructions:
0) Follow the setup instructions on [this page](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#setup) titled "The Bash Shell", "Git" and "Python". Basically, everything under "Setup" not including "R." 
      - For python, install Anaconda.
      - The videos may be helpful. 
      - These additional tutorials may also be helpful to skim:
            _Unix shell/command line:_ http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/
            _Version control with git:_ http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/
1) Open Terminal or other application for the bash or zsh command line (for Windows its the git bash introduced in the instructions above, for Mac and Linux its the Terminal)
2) `cd` into a directory that you want all of your bootcamp materials to live.
3) Type `git clone https://github.com/NRT-DSEER/intro-programming-2021.git`
4) Type `cd intro-programming-2021`
5) You're all set up! To start using notebooks, type `cd notebooks` and then type `jupyter notebook` 
6) This should open a new tab in your default browser and print a bunch of stuff in your terminal.
7) In the new tab that was just opened in your browser, click the notebook for the day of the course that you are on. For the first day, open "Day1_Setup.ipynb" and follow the instructions in that notebook to make sure you followed all the steps correctly.
8) Each day, start class by going into your bootcamp repo directory (`cd intro-programming-2021`) and typing `git pull`. Then follow steps 5-7

## Directory Structure:
`data` holds data

`notebooks` holds notebooks

`output` is where you will save your own files

Don't change the structure!

- 10:00am-12:30pm CT 
- We will not have class on Labor Day 9/6.

### Structure:
- Instructors will go over pre-written code and discuss the mechanics of what is going on
- We will stop intermittently for skill practice and breaks 
- Any code not covered should be completed outside of class with help from TAs
- Occasional, short skill practice problems as homework 

### How to ask for help:
- Go to the office hours of any of the TAs
- If you need help outside of class time or office hours, contact one of the TAs via their preferred communication channel (listed under their name). They will respond during their office hours.
- During class, post to your slack channel and your TA will respond in real time
