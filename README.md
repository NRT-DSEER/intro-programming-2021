# Introduction to Scientific Computing 2021 Bootcamp Materials
This repo houses data and notebooks for the 2021 DSEER "Introduction to Scientific Computing" bootcamp.

## Instructions:
0) Follow the setup instructions on [this page](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#setup) titled "The Bash Shell", "Git" and "Python". Basically, everything under "Setup" not including "R." 
      - For python, install Anaconda.
      - The videos may be helpful. 
      - These additional tutorials may also be helpful to skim:
            _Unix shell/command line:_ http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/
            _Version control with git:_ http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/
1) Open Terminal or other application for the bash or zsh command line (for Windows its the git bash introduced in the instructions above, for Mac and Linux its the Terminal)
2) `cd` into a directory that you want all of your bootcamp materials to live.
3) Type `git clone https://github.com/NRT-DSEER/intro-programming-2021.git`
4) Type `cd intro-programming-2021`
5) You're all set up! To start using notebooks, type `cd notebooks` and then type `jupyter notebook` which should open a new tab in your default browser, and print a bunch of random stuff in your terminal.
6) Each day, start class by going into your bootcamp repo directory (`cd intro-programming-2021`) and typing `git pull`

## Directory Structure:
`data` holds data

`notebooks` holds notebooks

`output` is where you will save your own files

Don't change the structure!
